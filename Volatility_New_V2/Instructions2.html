    <p>
        At this time, we wish to explain the rules that determine how much you will be paid in this experiment. At the end of the explanation stage and before the experiment itself begins, you will be asked to answer several questions that are meant to make sure that you understand the rules of the experiment clearly.
        Your answers to these questions will not affect the payments that you will receive at the end of the experiment. We will begin the experiment only after all participants understand the rules clearly.
