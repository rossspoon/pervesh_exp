    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Decision Making</h1>
    <p>
        During this experiment, you will make several decisions that will affect both your payment and the payments of
        the other members of your group at the end of the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experiment consists of 20 rounds. At the start of each round, you will decide on a tax rate for that round.
        Once all group members have submitted their tax choices, the computer will calculate the **median tax rate**,
        which will be applied as the group's tax rate. For instance, if the tax rates chosen by the group are 10%, 15%,
        and 20%, the group's median tax rate will be 15%.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the median tax rate is determined, the computer will randomly select your income for that round from your
        assigned income distribution. The group's median tax rate will then be applied to your income to calculate the
        tax deducted. The total tax revenue collected from the group will be shared equally among all members.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Imagine the group's median tax rate is 15%, and the individual incomes are as follows:
        100 (yours), 200, and 300. The tax deducted will be:
        <ul>
            <li>15 (for you),</li>
            <li>30 (for the second member),</li>
            <li>45 (for the third member).</li>
        </ul>
        This results in a total tax revenue of 90 (15 + 30 + 45). Each group member will receive an equal share of
        the tax revenue, which is 30 (90 รท 3). The final incomes will then be:
        <ul>
            <li>115 for you (100 - 15 + 30),</li>
            <li>200 for the second member (200 - 30 + 30),</li>
            <li>285 for the third member (300 - 45 + 30).</li>
        </ul>
        <em>Note:</em> You will not have access to information about the income or decisions of other group members.
        This example is provided solely to illustrate how the process works.

    <p>
        After each round, you will be given details about the results of your choice.
