    <p>
        This is an experiment in group decision-making. During the experiment, you will make decisions, and the other participants will do so as well. Your decisions and those of the others will determine the payment that you will receive according to rules that we will explain later on.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experiment will be carried out using a computer. All the decisions you make will be executed through specific commands entered into the system. Please stay completely silent throughout the experiment and refrain from speaking with other participants. Ensure your cell phones are turned off. If you have any questions, raise your hand, and a supervisor will assist you.
